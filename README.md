# neovim configs

[neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) configurations used by [PrankyMat](https://github.com/prankymat).

Feel free to use the configuartions in this repo. I recommend building your own nvim config from scratch though.

If you have any suggestions to my configuration, feel free to fork and make a pull request! (Or open a new issue for discussion.)
